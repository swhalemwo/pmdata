*** PMDB_FILE
go to google sheets, downloads as .csv


*** MOW
Museums of the World (MOW) is a database created and (somewhat) maintained by deGruyter.
#
Access was acquired by the UvA library as part of the "Return of the Medici" project in 2021, after which the database was sent by deGruyter in machine-readable format ("MOW2020_Output.xml").
#
Parsing of the XML file is done in python ("mow.py"), which produces three csv files:
- mow.csv: the main file with museum information: ID, name, location, opening year, number of branches/staff;
  one line per museum (55k entries)
- type.csv: links between museum ID and museum type (e.g. History Museum, Art Museum, Music Museum);
  multiple types are possible, therefore in long format (66k entries)
- classification.csv: links between museum ID and content classification (e.g. Art, Painting, Textiles, Agriculture);
  multiple types are possible, therefore in long format (59k entries)

links between MOW and PMDB are created through manual fuzzy string matching via the consult frameworks of emacs ("match_pmdb_mow.el" provides the function, "mow-museums.el" is the list of MOW museums so that they can be imported into emacs) and R ("match_pmdb_mow.R", which handles generates the museum entries to check, and also details the post-match checks).

This produces "mow_pmdb_matchres.csv": a list of PMDB ID and where available, the correponding MOW ID.
