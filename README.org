** how to update data files

*** PMDB

go to google sheets, downloads as .csv

#+begin_src dot :file doc/pmdb_flow.png
digraph D {
  node[shape = "record"]
  PMDB -> gd_pmdb_excl
  gd_pmdb_excl -> gd_pmdb

  

  gd_pmdb -> t_gwd_pmdb_founder_person
  PMDB_FOUNDER_PERSON_FILE -> t_gwd_pmdb_founder_person[label="checks coverage"]
  t_gwd_pmdb_founder_person -> PMDB_FOUNDER_PERSON_FILE[label="writes once"]

  
}
#+end_src

*** MOW
Museums of the World (MOW) is a database created and (somewhat) maintained by deGruyter. Access was acquired by the UvA library as part of the "Return of the Medici" project in 2021, after which the database was sent by deGruyter in machine-readable format (`MOW2020_Output.xml`, which cannot be shared). Parsing of the XML file is done in python (`mow.py`), which produces three csv files:
- `mow.csv`: the main file with museum information: ID, name, location, opening year, number of branches/staff;
  one line per museum (55k entries)
- type.csv: links between museum ID and museum type (e.g. History Museum, Art Museum, Music Museum);
  multiple types are possible, therefore in long format (66k entries)
- classification.csv: links between museum ID and content classification (e.g. Art, Painting, Textiles, Agriculture);
  multiple types are possible, therefore in long format (59k entries)

Links between MOW and PMDB are created through manual fuzzy string matching via the consult frameworks of emacs ("match_pmdb_mow.el" provides the function, "mow-museums.el" is the list of MOW museums so that they can be imported into emacs) and R ("match_pmdb_mow.R", which handles generates the museum entries to check, and also details the post-match checks).

This produces "mow_pmdb_matchres.csv": a list of PMDB ID and where available, the correponding MOW ID.
